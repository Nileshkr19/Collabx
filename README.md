# TeamFlow 🚀  
**A modern collaboration platform for teams**

TeamFlow is a full-stack collaboration platform designed to help teams **communicate, manage tasks, and collaborate efficiently** in one place.  
The project is built with a strong focus on **scalable architecture**, **clean domain modeling**, and **real-world backend and frontend separation**, similar to modern SaaS products.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

TeamFlow aims to combine essential team collaboration features such as:
- Team-based communication
- Task management with deadlines
- Role-based access control
- Notifications and activity tracking

The project is being developed incrementally, starting with a **solid backend foundation**, followed by frontend and real-time features.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Philosophy

- **Backend-first development**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable relational database design
- REST-based APIs
- Real-time features layered on top of a stable core

Each major part of the system is maintained and documented separately.
